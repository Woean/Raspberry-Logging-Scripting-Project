# Raspberry-Logging-Scripting-Project

This is a project with a raspberry pi and a simple combinated humidity and temperature sensor, 
where we wrote a few scripts to get the values (optional per cronjob) into a database,
plot a simple graph from time/temperature and make some analytic outputs.
Used technologies: mariadb, python, bash
